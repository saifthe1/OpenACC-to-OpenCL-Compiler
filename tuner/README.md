libOpenACC's Tuning Module
==========================

This module uses the data-base produced by the Code Generator to:
* generates the search space
* produces a profile for each point in the search space
* (TODO) analyses the profiles

The current version of the tuner is specialized for matrix multiply on one device (test 109).
