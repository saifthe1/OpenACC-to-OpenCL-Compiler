# This script takes care of the initial building of ROSE for the OpenACC to OpenCL Compiler
# It can be used after pulling a new version of the main repository.
# However, in this case, ROSE will be rebuilt from scratch, it will take a long time.
# If you use a powerfull machine you should change "-j4" by some thing larger (number of parallel processes used by make)
